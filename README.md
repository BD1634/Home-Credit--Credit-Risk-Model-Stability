Participated in a competitive project aimed at predicting clients' likelihood of defaulting on loans, with an emphasis on model stability over time. Leveraged data science techniques to develop robust predictive models that balance performance and stability, addressing the challenge of changing client behaviors. Contributed to creating more reliable scorecards for consumer finance providers, enhancing their ability to assess potential clients' default risks and broadening financial inclusion for individuals with little or no credit history.

Key Contributions:

Developed machine learning models to predict loan default risk.
Focused on ensuring model stability and long-term reliability.
Utilized various statistical and data analysis methods to improve prediction accuracy.
Enhanced the accessibility of loans to underbanked populations by providing more accurate risk assessments.
Collaborated with a team to refine and validate predictive models.
This project underlines my commitment to using data science for social good, aligning with my interest in technology-driven solutions for societal challenges.
